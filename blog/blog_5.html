						<!--Actual text-->
						<p>On March 31st 2016 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4cqyia/for_your_reading_pleasure_our_2015_transparency/">reddit
			  posted their annual transparency report.</a> It was missing it’s
							<a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2014/04/warrant-canary-faq">canary</a> which can only mean they received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter">National
			  Security Letter</a> and can no longer be trusted with any of your information. So I think I’ll take this opportunity to share some of my feelings about privacy and the (unconstitutional) mass surveillance happening right now in the United States.</p>
						<p>First things first I’ll very briefly explain the situation with Reddit for anyone who may be unfamiliar. It is ranked as the 9th most popular website in the US. and is used as a place for discussion for many different groups of people. Many popular
							websites post something called a transparency report regularly that shows all the calls for private information on users, DMCA take downs and many other legal requests they received and either declined or followed through with. In 2001 The Patriot
							act was passed giving the federal government a way to force a company to comply to their requests for information with something called a National Security Letter or NSL for short. The worst part about these requests is they can’t really be challenged
							and when you get them you’re not allowed to say you’ve gotten one. So the website is forced to give up all it’s users private information and is unable to tell it’s users that their data is no longer safe. To counteract this dystopian system websites
							started posting something called a canary that simply meant they had NOT received an NSL. If they suddenly stop posting the canary they obviously have received an NSL but cannot say they have received one. Reddit didn’t post theirs. Many people
							at first thought it was possibly a mistake, but in the comments of the announcement thread when asked if not posting the canary was a mistake the CEO of Reddit Steve Huffman (spez) said “I've been advised not to say anything one way or the other.”
							Clearly confirming that a gag order was issued and he isn’t allowed to talk about it.

						<p>
							Plenty of people have many legitimate reasons to want privacy and fear the government spying on us constantly (without purposely telling us either). Some just because at the end of the day we are supposed to be their employers and the rampant spying clearly
							violates our 4th amendment. Others because they have radical political views or are just simply of a religion or race that could be targeted if certain people come into power. It wouldn’t be the first time the country that screams freedom has unjustly
							prosecuted minorities. Events like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare">Red
			  Scare</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans">Internment
			  of Japanese Americans</a>,
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Treatment
			  of Native Americans</a>,
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States">and
			  institutional racism</a> that was very prevalent just 50 years ago are very valid reasons for why we have a right to privacy and why police have to get warrants.
						</p>
						<p>All that was probably a little heavy if you didn’t know much about the topic. Luckily there is some hope. A few candidates want to repeal or at least restrict the power of the patriot act and there are organizations out there like <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>							and recently a few major tech companies (whether just as a marketing stunt or not I don’t know) so there is some hope of the U.S. going back to a less scared and more free nation in the future.
						</p>
						<p>The best way to actually stop all this spying is to be educated, vote and to tell your representatives how you feel about new bills relating to privacy. Also you can resist or even prevent the spying on yourself by using better and more secure tools
							and services. For example if you use Facebook or many of the other popular social networking sites keep in mind that everything you say is being collected, sent to the feds, and sold to 3rd party companies.</p>
						<p>Below is a list of most of the tools and services I use/recommend to help stop the spying while still giving you a really good user experience. They are pretty much all open source, because in general going with open source programs is not only
							safer for your privacy, but also free and commonly a less advertised but better piece of software. <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">For
			  a more comprehensive list of all the best privacy tools </a><a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">check
			  out this site.</a></p>
						<p><b>Web
			  Browser: </b><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> which is extremely fast and open source or even the more secure but less user friendly <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">tor
			  browser</a></p>
						<p><b>Ad
			  Blocker: </b><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Ublock
			  Origin</a> (blocking ads will also prevent ads that track and contain malware)</p>
						<p><b>Email:
			  </b><a href="https://www.tutanota.com/">Tutanota</a> or <a href="https://www.ghostmail.com/">Ghostmail</a> (they encrypt your data and don’t sell off your emails like many of the major free and some paid email providers out there)</p>
						<p><b>Search
			  Engine: </b><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> (Google, Bing or Yahoo don’t respect your privacy as a business model)</p>
						<p><b>Voice
			  Chat: </b><a href="https://wire.com/">Wire</a> or <a href="https://tox.chat/">Tox</a> personally I like wire more because it just feels like Skype with new cool features and without random crashes and spying.</p>
						<p><b>Cloud
			  Storage: </b><a href="https://owncloud.org/">Owncloud</a> and <a href="https://www.seafile.com/en/home/">Seafile</a> (while a little more work to set up, hosting your own cloud data storage will prevent your data from being sold and spied on like
							it would be if you used Google Drive, Dropbox, One Drive, Apple, or pretty much any other closed course cloud storage company)</p>
						<p><b>Password
			  Manager: </b><a href="http://keepass.info/download.html">KeePassx</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper">simply
			  paper and a pen</a> (keeping different passwords for most of the sites and tools you use is a really great way to stop your data from being criminals and the government alike)</p>
						<p><b>Operating
			  system: </b><a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Mint
			  Linux</a>,
							<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>,
							<a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>,
							<a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, and <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch
			  Linux</a> are all great free and open source options. Mint and Ubuntu are very user friendly and easy enough to setup that even someone without too much technical knowledge should be able to install them or at least find a friend who will help you
							install them. (If you’re using Windows or OSX which most of you are your keystrokes and plenty of other sensitive information is already being recorded)</p>
						<p><b>Disk
			  Encryption: </b><a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/">Veracrypt</a> or <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GNU
			  Privacy Guard</a> are excellent disk encryption programs. Many linux distros will come with disk encryption software and even give you the option to enable it during the installation (disk encryption makes it so no body can read your hard drive and
							see all your files even if they steal your computer… unless of course they have your password)</p>
						<p><b>Mobile
			  OS: </b><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">Cyanogen
			  Mod</a> is the best choice if your phone model is supported. It’s an open source and very fast phone operating system based on androids code that doesn’t spy on you or give you a bunch of bloated apps you can’t remove.</p>
						<p>This is obviously only a rough outline to give you a general idea of the types of programs and utilities that you could start migrating over to in order to protect your privacy. Most aren’t based in the U.S. So they won’t be able to be sent NSL.
							Don’t hold me responsible though as some things may have changed since the time of writing this. Instead look into these tools a bit yourself and maybe do some research. As I mentioned before <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytools.io</a>							is a pretty great resource for this.
