		  	<p>
					<p>Over
					the past few weeks, I have begun a new venture in my programming
					career in an effort to get back into game development and to start
					making games that I&rsquo;m actually proud of. I&rsquo;m learning
					C++.
					</p>
					<p>I
					started by getting the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-Edition/dp/0321992784">&ldquo;Programming
					Principles and Practice Using C++ 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition&rdquo; by
					Bjarne Stroustrup</a> (the creator of C++). I found it to be
					extremely well written and full of great examples and challenges.
					Once I finish the book &ndash; which should hopefully happen by the
					end of this month &ndash; I want to move into doing some of the
					challenges on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer
					subreddit.</a> (If you haven&rsquo;t heard of this sub get go check
					it out right now &ndash; it has hundreds of great little challenges.
					Also, if you are confused, you can check the comments and see how
					others were able to solve it so you can get a better idea of where
					you went wrong.)</p>
					<p>I
					think once I feel comfortable with C++ and can complete most of the
					easy and medium challenges without too much hair loss I&rsquo;ll
					start learning an engine because engines are great and writing big
					games like I want to make in C++ alone isn&rsquo;t really practical.
					The engine I&rsquo;m looking into right now is <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal
					Engine.</a> I&rsquo;ve downloaded and messed around with it a few
					times before (and it uses C++ as the scripting language so that&rsquo;s
					a huge plus). Part of the reason I&rsquo;m learning C++ and want to
					get <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal</a>
					instead of say, <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, the other
					big competitor I was looking into a bit, is that Unity still doesn&rsquo;t
					have a linux engine. I do most of my work on linux boxes these days
					and I&rsquo;m not about to use a vm every time I want to do some game
					design.
