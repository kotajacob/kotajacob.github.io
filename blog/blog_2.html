				Over the past few
		  weeks I have begun a new venture in my programming career in an
		  effort to get back into game development and start making games that
		  I'm actually proud of. I'm learning C++. I started by getting the
		  book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-Edition/dp/0321992784">“Programming
		  Principles And Practice Using C++ 2nd Edition” by Bjarne Stroustrup</a>
		  the creator of C++. I found it to be extremely well written and full
		  of great examples and challenges. Once I finish the book which should
		  hopefully happen by the end of this month I want to move into doing
		  some of the challenges on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer
		  subreddit.</a> If you haven't heard of this sub yet go check it out
		  right now it has hundreds of great little challenges ranging from
		  really simple like making tic tac toe to ones that would take an
		  expert all day. Also if you are confused you can check the comments
		  and see how others were able to solve it so you can get an idea of
		  how you went wrong.
	  		</p>
		  	<p>
			  I think once I feel
		  comfortable with C++ and can complete most of the easy and medium
		  challenges without too much hair loss I'll start learning an engine
		  because engines are great and writing big games that I want to make
		  in  C++ alone isn't really practical. The engine I'm looking at the
		  most right now is <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal
		  Engine</a>. I've downloaded and messed around with it a few times
		  before and it uses C++ as the scripting language so that's a huge
		  plus. Part of the reason I'm learning C++ and want to get Unreal
		  instead of say Unity, the other big competitor I was looking into a
		  bit, is that Unity still doesn't have a linux engine and I do most of
		  my work on linux boxes these days and I'm not about to use a vm every
		  time I want to do some game design. It's actually pretty surprising
		  that they STILL don't have a linux engine yet considering they are
		  well known for exporting to so many different devises and of course
		  the whole being free thing probably helped with their fame.
