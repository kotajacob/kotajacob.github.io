						<!--Actual text-->
						<p>Replacing the electoral college with a simple popular vote is one of those things that <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=petition+to+abolish+electoral+college&oq=petition+to+&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.4371j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8'>on paper looks like a really good idea</a>, but in practice however would be a very dangerous switch with our current technology. First of all the reason most people want to get rid of the electoral college is because of the fact that the <a href='http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hillary-clinton-set-to-win-popular-vote-even-as-shes-lost-the-presidency-2016-11-09'>president who receives the most votes isn&#39;t always the one elected</a> which understandably sounds really stupid. These people also usually point out that the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)#History'>electoral college is from a time when votes were all counted by hand</a> and it was simply unfeasible to use a popular vote. Naturally now when we have spaceships and artificial intelligence it can&#39;t possibly be that difficult to have a decent voting system that makes sense. Unfortunately however there are several pretty major problems that would be introduced if we abolished the electoral college and used a popular vote, arguably far worse than the problems we currently have with the electoral college.</p>
						<p><b>1. Certainty</b></p>
						<p>The certainty of all the votes in the electoral college <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_election_recount'>has already happened before in 2000</a> and would surely happen at every election moving forward if we just used a popular vote since it would be so much closer and the counting would have to be far more perfect. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012'>Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral college but only 51.3 percent of the popular vote</a> so rather than a simple winner there would have to be recounts in any state that the candidate thinks might give them more votes causing uncertainty and turmoil.</p>
						<p><b>2. Support</b></p>
						<p>Without the electoral college the entire way candidates campaign would vastly change. Rather than having to go from state to state and convince the entire country that they&#39;re the best person for the job they could just campaign extremely heavily in the states where they&#39;re already liked and wind up winning with only the bible belt of states and having the rest of the country hate them. Again causing far more turmoil and separating the country further than if they had a decent amount of supporters throughout the country.</p>
						<p><b>3. Security</b></p>
						<p>In our current system <a href='https://blog.cylance.com/cylance-discloses-voting-machine-vulnerability'>it&#39;s relatively easy to hack a voting machine and give yourself extra votes,</a> <a href='https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/795429334286635008'>but extremely challenging to evade the statistical analysis</a> that&#39;s done after the election (which would land you in federal prison if caught). The main reason for this is because to win just a single state hundreds of hackers would have to go vote in a ton of different counties all without getting caught, if they added too many votes each they would surely be caught. Obviously the amount of planning that would take would be impossible without anyone finding out about it. If a simple popular vote was used it would be much easier to hack thousands of votes just by finding a fairly insecure machine and then simply adding as many votes as you want to the total (more votes makes it riskier of course). This would of course eliminate needing thousands of hackers all going to different booths throughout hundreds of counties in multiple states and instead only require a few people and knowledge of an insecure voting machine. While yes the individual who actually hacked the machine might get caught a few days after the election once a full analysis is done it wouldn&#39;t matter because he would&#39;ve already stolen the election. Meaning a candidate&#39;s committee could pay a handful of people <a href='https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?disp=C'>large amounts of money</a> to fake votes, flee the country, and deny that it was the party that paid them.</p>
						<p>So while the electoral college has many problems it&#39;s still the best system we have and can&#39;t just easily be abolished without many major consequences. You don&#39;t have to give up all hope though, because the good news is there are people working on finding other methods of voting reform more worthwhile to look into.</p>
