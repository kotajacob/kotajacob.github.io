          <!--Actual text-->
					<p>I recently made the
					switch, at the beginning of this year I decided to start using Linux
					on at least one of my daily computers. I went with my laptop because
					I wouldn’t be trying to game on it and I really wanted the extra
					speed that comes with a light weight install. After the first few
					days I knew there wasn’t even a chance I’d ever go back to
					windows on my laptop. Things actually work well and make sense. I
					don’t really feel like I’m jumping through loops just to do
					relatively simple things on my laptop like I did when I was using
					windows and I feel like I’m actually in control and can do what I
					want with my computer rather than using strange workarounds to have a
					little control in windows.</p>
					<img src="images/2_laptop_desktop.png" data-action="zoom" style="float:left;margin:20px 20px 0px 20px;width:60%;height:60%;">
					<p>I’m not exactly a
					beginner and went with <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">arch</a>
					for my laptop with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_%28software%29">cinnamon</a>
					as my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment">DE</a>.
					I went with cinnamon mostly because other people might use my laptop
					from time to time and I didn’t want them to be confused by gnome or
					worse I3 and arch because it’s fun and I don’t have enough
					packages for things to get unstable or break. I’m using the <a href="https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme">arc
					gtk theme</a> and <a href="https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle">numix
					circle icons</a> (I know everyone uses numix, but damn there’s a
					reason.)
					</p>
					<p>If you’re new and
					want to get a taste of a Linux OS I’d recommend trying <a href="http://linuxmint.com/">Mint
					Linux</a> or <a href="http://xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a>. Both are made
					to be easy and will look and feel relatively familiar to you if
					you’re used to windows. If you’re coming from Apple and want to
					try something that will feel similar maybe check out <a href="https://elementary.io/">Elementary</a>,
					I haven’t used it myself but lots of people love it and it’s a
					pretty solid experience for beginners. If you or whoever you’re
					installing Linux for doesn’t have very much previous experience and
					they have a computer that’s relatively new then maybe even go with
					the most popular desktop distro <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>
					because it is extremely easy and has tons of helpful support.</p>
					<p>Linux, contrary to
					popular belief, isn’t exactly only for computer experts. As a
					matter of fact the people who seem to love it the most immediately
					are people who have very little experience and people who have a very
					large amount of experience. Most of the beginner Linux distros are
					extremely intuitive and easy for kids and the elderly to learn very
					quickly. Windows 10 on the other hand isn’t actually that intuitive
					at all and most new users are a little confused by the fact that
					there are essentially two UI’s the fullscreen thing that came with
					windows 8 and the old desktop environment that everyone understands.
					Not only that, but if you want to change a setting you have to figure
					out if it’s in the control panel, the new PC settings menu, or if
					you simply can’t do it at all. For example I wanted to make my
					windows only update when I tell it to rather than it just deciding it
					wants to spend twenty minutes updating when I’m turning it on to
					print something out before school in the morning. This wasn’t a
					simple setting though. Instead I had to edit a registry key and even
					after all that I still had a problem with it. It would randomly give
					me a full-screen notification telling me to update. You could just
					ignore it and not update, but it was pretty annoying when it
					alt-tabbed me out of competitive game to tell me to update.</p>
					<p>Another thing that
					makes Linux easier to use than windows is the fact that they have
					repositories for just about every program you could want.
					Repositories are kinda like the app store on your phone. As a matter
					of fact the app stores on your phone is basically just package
					repositories with a user interface. Many of the popular distros come
					with a simple program like the Ubuntu software center that you can
					open and install programs from. Or if you want to try the package
					manger in a terminal window you just have to run a simple command
					like <code>sudo pacman -S firefox</code>
					That’s the command to install Firefox in Arch Linux.
					It’s really that easy. The best part is these
					repositories are monitored so that none of the programs have viruses
					or things that will spy on you and mess up your computer. It’s a
					lot safer than just going to random websites to download your
					programs like windows. Also whenever you want to update your computer
					you can have it update all of these programs rather than just your
					operating system. No more opening up some program you downloaded from
					some random website and being asked to do a bunch of strange things
					to update it so you can finally use it. Just one click and everything
					can be updated.</p>
					<p>That’s why I
					switched. That and the fact that it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free
					and open source</a> so I can do whatever I want with my computer and
					even tweak it and give out my tweaks online. As of today every single
					computer in my house is using Linux and they are all running far
					faster and with far less problems. Some of them are running Xubuntu
					because of how fast and easy it is, some are running Arch because of
					how you can do anything you want with it and it’s fun to know
					exactly how everything works, and two other computers are running
					<a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> because of how <a href="http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=36447">stable
					and amazing</a> it is for <a href="https://www.apache.org/">running a
					web-server</a>, <a href="http://www.cups.org/">a print server</a>, or
					<a href="https://owncloud.org/">a file server.</a></p>
