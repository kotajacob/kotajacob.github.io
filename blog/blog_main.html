          <!--Actual text-->
		  <p>So you want to make
		  your first video game, but have no idea where to begin? Well you're
		  in luck because today I'm going to explain how to make your own
		  simple computer game with an easy to use game development engine
		  called Gamemaker. <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/studio">I will be
		  using Gamemaker Studio</a> but just about everything done in these
		  tutorials should work in the slightly older legacy versions such as
		  Gamemaker 6, 7 and 8. You can download and use Gamemaker for free if
		  you don't already have it. There is a couple of paid versions if you
		  get really into it that will give you many more features such as
		  exporting to the web and phones but for now I would recommend just
		  getting the free version to try it out.</p>
		  <p>When you first open
		  Gamemaker it will present you with a pretty basic window with some
		  folders on the one side and lots of buttons in a toolbar at the top.
		  <img src="images/1_gamemaker_sidebar.png" data-action="zoom">
		  Each of the folders on the side represents a different type of
		  recourse that you can put in your game. Sprites for example are
		  basically images which you will use as your character, the walls, the
		  enemies, and pretty much any other &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that you see
		  in your game. Sprites can be animated and move around in your game on
		  top of things called objects. Objects are another recourse and are
		  the real backbone of any game. They work using a system of events and
		  actions. When an event happens, say the player of your game presses a
		  button on his keyboard you can have the object do something, an
		  action. There are many different types of actions ranging all the way
		  from simply moving a few pixels over on the screen, to changing
		  color, and starting a count down timer.</p>
		  <p>To be continued
		  (like we'll actually start making the game in part 1)</p>
