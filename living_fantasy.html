I started working on Living Fantasy when I realized the sad reality that
most of the card games I love have a huge luck element. Yes of course if
you were very good you would beat beginner player almost every time you played
but, sometimes you would just get a crappy hand or role the dices wrong.
Which in a way was a great element to most card games. The problem occurs
when you want to treat a card game as a competitive game. In most other
popular competitive games I've played one of the major things that stood out
from other games in their genre's was the lack of a luck based element.
That and the fact that when you played the game it wasn't your character
getting stronger, you didn't level up, the only thing getting better was you.

Then came the challenging task of actually coming up with a card game system
that isn't based around luck. Which is a bit more tricky than you might imagine.
Eventually I determined you can't have luck of the draw so instead of
starting the game having all your cards in a random order in your deck you put
your whole deck in your hand at the beginning of the game. In most other card
games of this type you have mana that you must use up on each turn to play
cards. In this game there is a combination of a mana system and something a bit
different then usual. You can at anytime discard to get an extra mana.
As a matter of fact that is the main way to get mana other than the few mana
your are given at the start of each of your turns.

Each player has 40 health and the goal of the game is to use your cards to play
monsters, spells and powers in order to make your opponents health 0. The hard
part is that your opponent is doing the same thing and if you loose you can't
blame it on your "bad luck".
